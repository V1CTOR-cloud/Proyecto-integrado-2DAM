# About our App:

DailySense its an app that aims to the managment and care for the ones who needs the most, in a simple and organized way.

Our app is developed from the fact that most of the nursing homes are not uptaded to the new technologies, and they still use paper or 
old computer to store the information of their residents. With our app every carer would be able to have on their phone the most essential 
info of the ones he or she has on care. But also can be used to the carers that are freelance and go to particular homes and want to have 
an easy form to store all the information they need.

Since this is not a exploded field we could easily stand out for the few competency we could have.
